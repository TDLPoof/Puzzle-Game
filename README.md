The key for mapmaking:

S = Sand (Ground)

W = Wall

D = Door

E = Exit Portal

B = Black Fliptile

X = White Fliptile

I = Ice (unused)

J = Jump Tile

C = Cracked Tile

H = Hole (pretty much wall)

R = Red Door

G = Green Door

F = Blue Door

0 = Red Switch

1 = Green Switch

2 = Blue Switch

Make sure to create maps as rectangles! (Use the Black Tile ONLY to fill empty spaces)
